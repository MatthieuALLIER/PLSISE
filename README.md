# PLSISE Project

Our project is part of the R programming course taught in the Master Data Science of the University Lumière Lyon 2. The main objective of this project is to set up the creation of a package under the R Studio software by integrating the PLS-DA method (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis Regression). The final goal is to be able to install our package directly from Github. 

## PLS-DA
The regression method of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, or supervised classification, is a technique generally used in chemometrics to optimize the separation between different groups of samples. It consists of a first data matrix X corresponding to the different characteristics (independant variables) and the second matrix Y which corresponds to the group, to the membership of a class (dependant variable). This method is in fact an extension of the PLS1 method which treats a single continuous dependent variable whereas the PLS2 method, also called PLS-DA can treat several categorical dependent variables. 

It is a method to maximize the covariance between the independent variables X and the dependent variable Y of highly multidimensional data by finding a linear subspace of the explanatory variables. The new subspace allows the prediction of the variable Y based on a reduced number of factors corresponding to the PLS components. Thus, these factors covering the subspace on which the independent variables are projected describe the behavior of the dependent variables Y.

## Package 
The installation of the package is required and is done directly through the Github access. In order to do this ...

Once the installation is successful, you can now access all the features of the package, especially the functions you see below.
- fit
- prediction
- Variable selection
- ...
