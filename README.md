# PLSISE

Our project is part of the R programming course taught in the Master Data Science of the University Lumière Lyon 2. The main objective of this project is to set up the creation of a package under the R Studio software by integrating the PLS-DA method (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis Regression). The final goal is to be able to install our package directly from Github. 

## PLS-DA
PLS-DA, a clustering or supervised classification method, is a chemometrics technique used to optimize the separation between different groups of samples, which is completed by linking two data matrices X (i.e., raw data) and Y (i.e., groups, class membership, etc. .). This method is in fact an extension of the PLS1 method which handles a single continuous dependent variable whereas PLS2 (called PLS-DA) can handle several categorical dependent variables. This method aims to maximize the covariance between the independent variables X (sample readings, the metabolomic data) and the corresponding dependent variable Y (groups or classes) of highly multidimensional data by finding a linear subspace of the explanatory variables. The new subspace allows the prediction of the variable Y based on a reduced number of factors (PLS components, or so-called potential variables). These factors that cover the subspace on which the independent variables X are projected describe the behavior of the dependent variables Y.
