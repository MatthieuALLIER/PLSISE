# PLSISE

Our project is part of the R programming course taught in the Master Data Science of the University Lumière Lyon 2. The main objective of this project is to set up the creation of a package under the R Studio software by integrating the PLS-DA method (Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis Regression). The final goal is to be able to install our package directly from Github. 

## PLS-DA
The regression method of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, or supervised classification, is a technique generally used in chemometrics to optimize the separation between different groups of samples. It consists of a first data matrix X corresponding to the different characteristics and the second matrix Y which corresponds to the group, to the membership of a class. This method is in fact an extension of the PLS1 method which treats a single continuous dependent variable whereas the PLS2 method, also called PLS-DA can treat several categorical dependent variables.
